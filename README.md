# Superstore-analysis

The Dataset used in this project was that of a superstore containing orders made by different customers from the year 2014 to 2017. Analysis was done on the dataset to gain insights and make effective decision-making. The tool used to perform this task was Microsoft Excel. With Excel, I was able to perform steps that included the following

I.  Data Cleaning

II.  Data Processing

III.  Data Analysis

IV.  Data Visualization

DATA CLEANING
---
Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset to improve its quality and reliability for analysis or modeling. This typically involves tasks such as removing duplicate entries, handling missing values, correcting data formatting issues, and detecting and rectifying outliers.
In the dataset, it was discovered that 1 duplicate data was found. All columns were converted to the correct data format and all missing values were solved by dropping the rows that contained the missing values.

In the column named Category, it was discovered that some rows had the category spelled wrongly as it was seen that Furniture was spelled furtiure and Technology spelled as Techonology. This was solved by using the Find all and replace all feature present in Excel.

PROCESSING
---
Data processing refers to the manipulation and transformation of raw data into a more useful format or structure. It involves tasks such as sorting, summarizing, aggregating, filtering, and transforming data to extract meaningful insights or support decision-making.

In the dataset, the following columns were created by applying the correct formulas to be able to extract more meaningful insights

I.  Sales/Quantity

II.  Cost price/Quantity

III.  Profit/Quantity

DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION
---

Data analysis involves interpreting data to extract insights, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. Data visualization is the graphical representation of data to visually communicate insights, trends, and patterns. It involves creating charts, graphs, and other visualizations to help understand complex data sets and present findings clearly and understandably. Data visualization enhances understanding and aids in decision-making by making data more accessible and intuitive to interpret.

Research questions were asked and answers were discovered

RESEARCH QUESTION 1
---

Why is the country experiencing some losses? The relationship was drawn between the discounts given on products and the profit gotten from each order. On analysis, it was discovered that products with higher discounts tend to run at losses for the company.

RESEARCH QUESTION 3
---

Categories of the returned orders? The returned orders were present in another table, with the use of INDEX and MATCH formulas, I was able to match the order ID with that of the main orders table, and with the use of the index, I got the category it belonged to. This helped the superstore know which category experienced more returned orders to know the next step to take. From the analysis, it was discovered that Office supplies had the most returned orders.

RESEARCH QUESTION 4

---

To find the total sales year-wise? Same approach is followed as discussed in Asked Question 2, the only difference is we apply the filter to filter by year and not days. For example, the image below shows the total sales made for the year 2014.
